# PyPoll with Python

## I. Overview of Project

### Background
Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, was tasked to do an election audit of their congressional precinct using Python. We were able to help him get the total votes, the number of votes for each candidate and their percentages, and the winner of the popular vote. 

### Objective
After successfully automating the election audit, he election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit: (1) the voter turnout for each county, (2) the percentage of votes from each county out of the total county and (3) the county with the highest turnout.
